# Associated Legendre Polynomials and Spherical Harmonics Computation for Chemistry Applications

A C++ library for accurate and efficient computation of associated Legendre polynomials and real spherical harmonics for use in chemistry applications.

Our algorithms are based on the following design principles:
- Normalize polynomials P*<sub>l</sub><sup>m</sup>* to avoid overflow/underflow.
- Use a RR in the direction of increasing *l* for ALPs for stability.
- Use trigonometric RRs for sin and cos functions in SHs to save time.
- Precompute coefficients in the RRs to reduce computational cost.
- Compute an entire set of normalized P*<sub>l</sub><sup>m</sup>* where *m* â‰¥ 0 in a single function call to reduce overhead.
- Avoid loop dependencies in inner loops, allowing operations to be vectorized and pipelined for execution.

A Makefile is provided to build the library in a Unix-like environment.
