#define ERRCUDACAOOM ("\n\
You ran out of memory on the GPU(s).\n\n\
Each MPI-rank running on a GPU increases the use of GPU-memory. Relion\n\
tries to distribute load over multiple GPUs to increase performance,\n\
but doing this in a general and memory-efficient way is difficult.\n\n\
1. Check the device-mapping presented at the beginning of each run,\n\
   and be particularly wary of 'device X is split between N slaves', which \n\
   will result in a higher memory cost on GPU X. In classifications, GPU-\n\
   sharing between MPI-ranks is typically fine, whereas it will usually \n\
   cause out-of-memory during the last iteration of high-resolution refinement.\n\n\
2. If you are not GPU-sharing across MPI-slave ranks, then you might be using a\n\
   too-big box-size for the GPU memory. Currently, N-pixel particle images\n\
   will require *roughly* \n\n\
\t\t    (1.1e-8)*(N*2)^3  GB  \n\n\
   of memory (per rank) during the final iteration of refinement (using\n\
   single-precision GPU code, which is default). 450-pixel images can therefore\n\
   just about fit into a GPU with 8GB of memory, since 11*(450*2)^3 ~= 8.02\n\
   During classifications, resolution is typically lower and N is suitably\n\
   reduced, which means that memory use is much lower.\n\n\
3. If the above estimation fits onto (all of) your GPU(s), you may have \n\
   a very large number of orientations which are found as possible during\n\
   the expectation step, which results in large arrays being needed on the \n\
   GPU. If this is the case, you should find large (>10'000) values of \n\
   '_rlnNrOfSignificantSamples' in your _data.star output files. You can try\n\
   adding the --maxsig <P>, flag, where P is an integer limit, but you \n\
   should probably also consult expertise or re-evaluate your data and/or \n\
   input reference. Seeing large such values means relion is finding nothing\n\
   to align.\n\n\
If none of the above applies, please report the error to the relion\n\

When trying to plan one or more Fourier transforms, it was found that the available\n\
GPU memory was insufficient. Relion attempts to reduce the memory by segmenting\n\
the required number of transformations, but in this case not even a single\n\
transform could fit into memory. Either you are (1) performing very large transforms,\n\
or (2) the GPU had very little available memory.\n\n\
	(1) may occur during autopicking if the 'shrink' parameter was set to 1. The \n\
	recommended value is 0 (--shrink 0), which is argued in the RELION-2 paper (eLife).\n\
	This reduces memory requirements proportionally to the low-pass used. \n\n\
	(2) may occur if multiple processes were using the same GPU without being aware\n\
	of each other, or if there were too many such processes. Parallel execution of \n\
	relion binaries ending with _mpi ARE aware, but you may need to reduce the number\n\
	of mpi-ranks to equal the total number of GPUs. If you are running other instances \n\
	of GPU-accelerated programs (relion or other), these may be competing for space.\n\
	Relion currently reserves all available space during initialization and distributes\n\
	this space across all sub-processes using the available resources. This behaviour \n\
	can be escaped by the auxiliary flag --free_gpu_memory X [MB]. You can also go \n\
	further and force use of full dynamic runtime memory allocation, relion can be \n\
	built with the cmake -DCachedAlloc=OFF\n")

alignment can become sensitive to numerical accuracies, and if relion \n\
