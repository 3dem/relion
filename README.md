# RELION


RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN) is a stand-alone computer
program for Maximum A Posteriori refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions
or 2D class averages in cryo-electron microscopy. It is developed in the
research group of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

The underlying theory of MAP refinement is given in a [scientific publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22100448)
. If RELION is useful in your work, please cite this paper.


The more comprehensive documentation of RELION is stored on the [Wiki](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion)

## Installation


More extensive options and configurations are available
[here](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php/Download_%26_install),
but the outlines to clone and install relion for typical use are made easy
through [cmake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake).

On ubuntu machines, installing cmake is as easy as

```
sudo apt install cmake build-essential mpi-default-bin mpi-default-dev libfftw3-dev
```

On other systems it is typically just as easy, you simply have to modify "apt" to
the appropriate package manager. You will also need [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which is just as easy;

```
sudo apt install git
```


Once git and cmake are installed, relion can be easily installed through
```
git clone https://github.com/3dem/relion.git
cd relion
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/ ..
make -j4
make install
```
(NOTE: "/where/to/install/ .." is typically "/usr/local/relion"
 Make sure you create this directory beforehand.
 You can do this using "sudo mkdir /usr/local/relion".  In that case, be sure
 to use "sudo make install" instead of "make install" in the last step.)

These steps will download the source-code, create a build-directory,
then configure and build relion, and lastely install it to be generally
available on the system.


## Updating


RELION is intermittently updated, with both minor and major features.
To update an existing installation, simply use the following commands

```
cd relion
git pull
cd build
make -j4
make

```
