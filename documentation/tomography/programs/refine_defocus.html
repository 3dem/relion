	<h1><tt>relion_tomo_refine_defocus</tt></h1>
	
	<p>This program estimates the astigmatic defoci of the individual tilt images. In tomography, the relative depth distances between the particles are known from the 3D positions of the particles. Therefore, only one defocus value is estimated for all the particles in each image. Because of the typically large number of particles in each tomogram, this value can be estimated to greater precision than in single-particle analysis.</p>
	
	<p>The estimated defoci are written into the output <a href="../data_types/tomogram_set.html">tomogram set</a> which replaces the given tomogram set in the output <a href="../data_types/optimisation_set.html">optimisation set</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Relevant program arguments:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>--i</b> and/or <b>--p</b>, <b>--t</b>, <b>--mot</b>, <b>--ref&lt;1/2&gt;</b>, <b>--mask</b> and <b>--fsc</b>: input optimisation-set and/or its components (see <a href="../data_types/optimisation_set.html">optimisation set</a>).</li>
		<li><b>--b</b>: box size to be used for the estimation. Note that this can be larger than the box size of the reference map. A sufficiently large box size allows more of the high-frequency signal to be captured that has been delocalised by the CTF.</li>
		<li><b>--no_astigmatism</b>: do not refine the astigmatism, but only a scalar defocus value. This is useful if the number of particles is too small to allow for accurate astigmatism estimation. If the number is even smaller, do not use this program.</li>
		<li><b>--j</b>: number of threads to be used. This should be set to the number of CPU cores available.</li>
		<li><b>--o</b>: name of the output directory (that will be created).</li>
	</ul>
